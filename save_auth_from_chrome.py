"""save_auth_from_chrome.py

Tries to connect to a running Chrome (your normal browser) via the DevTools
protocol and export the storage state (cookies + localStorage) for reuse by
Playwright. This lets the scraper run using your real logged-in session and
should avoid blocks that target automated headless browsers.

Usage:
1. If you already started Chrome with remote debugging enabled (port 9222), just
   run this script:
       python save_auth_from_chrome.py

2. If not, close Chrome and start it with remote debugging using PowerShell
   (replace the path if your Chrome is installed elsewhere):

   # Example PowerShell command (copy-paste):
   & "C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222

   Then run this script.

Notes:
- If you prefer to use a different port, set the environment variable
  PLAYWRIGHT_CDP_URL (for example "http://127.0.0.1:9223") before running.
- This script will attempt to use the first available browser context from
  the connected Chrome. If that succeeds it will save `auth.json` in the
  current directory.
